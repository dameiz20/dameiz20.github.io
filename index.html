            <p>Hello, my name is Dakota Meisel and I am a student in the software development program here at FVTC. I am cureently working as an Ultra Sonic rail tester. Me and my wife have just recently gotten married and we have also welcomed our first kid back in October. Being a dad has challenged me in ways i have never thought possible and has forced me to think outside of the box a lot as well.  </p>
